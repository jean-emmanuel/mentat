### Overview

Mentat is a HUB / Conductor for OSC / MIDI capable softwares. It aims to centralize all controls in one place, manage their state and create routings.

Mentat is a module for [python 3](https://www.python.org/) and requires writing code to work. If you're looking for a fully-featured software with a user interface, try [Chataigne](https://benjamin.kuperberg.fr/chataigne/en) instead.

Mentat has been designed to coordinate the live setup of the rap-in-opposition band [Plagiat](https://plagiat.org/clips) (see the project's [source repository](https://github.com/PlagiatBros/PlagiatSetupII/)).

### Requirements

```
python3 python3-liblo python3-pyalsa python3-pyinotify
```


### Install

```
git clone https://github.com/jean-emmanuel/mentat/
cd mentat
python3 setup.py install
```

### Usage

The typical use case for Mentat is a conductor for controlling a set of softwares during a live performance.

The [`Engine`](#engine) object is the main object, it manages the OSC / MIDI backends, the modules and the routes. It also holds a tempo, a cycle length (measure) and a time reference that's used to create timed scenes and sequences in a musical way (using beats instead of seconds).

[`Module`](#module) objects are interfaces between the controlled softwares and the engine. The `Module` class should be subclassed to
create dedicated module classes for different softwares.

A set of controllable parameters can be defined for each module, each parameter being an alias for an OSC / MIDI value in the controlled software.

Controlled parameters should only modified using the module's [`set()`](#module.set) and [`animate()`](#module.animate) methods in order to guarantee that the state of the modules reflects the actual state of the softwares. This removes the need for feedback from said softwares and allows us to trust Mentat as the source of truth during the performance.

All messages received by the engine that are coming from a software associated with a module are first passed to that module's  [`route()`](#module.route) method.

[`Route`](#route) objects represent the different parts of the performance (eg tracks / songs in a musical show). The `Engine` has one active route at a time and will pass all incoming messages to its [`route()`](#route.route) method.

Each track should be a dedicated class derived from the `Route` class. The [`route()`](#route.route) method definition will allow writing the actual routing that should occur during that track.


### Generic control API

In order to ensure state consistency, parameters should always be controlled by mentat. A generic command is exposed to control modules using osc messages, it allows calling any method owned by the engine and its modules:


`/engine_name/module_name/submodule_name/method_name <*arguments>`

**Examples**

```
/engine_name/set_route route_name
/engine_name/module_name/set parameter_name 1.0
/engine_name/module_name/submodule_name/animate parameter_name 1.0 10.0 1.0
```

### MIDI

Mentat treats MIDI messages as OSC messages. Modules with protocol set to `'midi'` will send and receive messages formatted as follows:


```
/note_on <int: channel> <int: note> <int: velocity>
/note_off <int: channel> <int: note>
/control_change <int: channel> <int: control> <int: value>
/program_change <int: channel> <int: program>
/pitch_bend  <int: channel> <int: pitch>
/sysex <*int: values>
```
